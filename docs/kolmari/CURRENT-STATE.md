# Kolmari Current State

Running log of implemented page state. Update this file when application code changes.

## Dashboard

**Layout.** Two-column flex row below the welcome block and profile banner:

- Left content column (`flex:1; min-width:0`) stacks the dark *Recommended next action* hero,
  the *Progress by planning area* card, an auto-fit grid of secondary cards
  (`repeat(auto-fit, minmax(252px, 1fr))`), the destinations strip, and the *Stay on track* bar.
- Right drawer column holds the Kolmari Tracker and animates its own width, so the
  left column reflows wider whenever the tracker is collapsed.

**Kolmari Tracker.** `src/components/kolmari/journey-drawer.tsx` — a vertical, collapsible
progress drawer on the right edge. Expanded it is a 322px panel listing all eight plan stages
on a connector rail with per-stage task lists (one stage open at a time, the current stage open
by default). Collapsed it becomes a 56px rail carrying the stage dots and a `n/8` counter.
Width animates 322px ↔ 56px over `.42s cubic-bezier(.4,0,.2,1)`. Under the 900px workspace
breakpoint the row stacks, the panel is always visible, and the rail is not used.

Styles live in the `.k-journey*` block in `src/app/globals.css`, alongside the other shared
component styles. No new tokens were introduced — navy, gold, teal, line, and muted all come
from the existing `@theme` block.

The previous horizontal stepper (`kolmari-tracker.tsx`) has been removed; the journey now reads
top-to-bottom in the drawer only.

**Data.** Every value in the tracker is derived from persisted plan data by
`journeyStages()` and `journeyPercent()` in `src/lib/plan-types.ts`:

- Stage position comes from `nexit_plans.journey_stage`.
- Stage task lists come from the user's saved checklist items, grouped by `stage`.
- A task is *blocked* only when it carries a real due date that has already passed.
- Completion percent is fully-passed stages plus the share of the current stage's saved tasks
  that are done. A stage with no saved tasks reports that it has none — no filler tasks,
  no assumed partial credit.
- The footer timestamp is `nexit_plans.updated_at`, formatted in UTC on the server, and reads
  "Not saved yet" when the plan has never been saved.

**Validation.** `tsc --noEmit`, `eslint` (changed files), and `next build` all pass. Verified in
Chromium at 420px, 1024px, and 1440px in both expanded and collapsed states.
